# **Hand Gesture Classification Using MediaPipe Landmarks from the HaGRID Dataset**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on classifying hand gestures using landmark data extracted by **MediaPipe** from the **HaGRID (Hand Gesture Recognition Image Dataset)**. The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying gestures based on the **x, y, z** coordinates of hand landmarks.

Students will gain experience in:  
✅ Data preprocessing and visualization  
✅ Model training and evaluation  
✅ Documentation and presentation of results

## **Dataset Details**
- The **HaGRID** dataset contains **18 hand gesture classes**.
- Each gesture is represented by **21 hand landmarks** (x, y, z) extracted using **MediaPipe**.
- The dataset is provided as a **CSV file**, where each row contains:  
  - **Landmark coordinates (x, y, z) for 21 keypoints**  
  - **Gesture label**  

### **Preprocessing Notes:**
- Hand landmarks vary in **scale and position**. To standardize them:  
  - **Recenter (x, y) coordinates** to make the wrist point the origin.  
  - **Normalize landmarks** by dividing by the mid-finger tip position.  
- The **z-location** does not require further processing.  
- **Stabilize output predictions** by applying a **moving mode filter** over a window.

## **Project Deliverables**
### ✅ **1. Google Colab Notebook**
A well-documented notebook uploaded to **GitHub** that includes:  
- 📌 **Data Loading:** Importing the CSV file and understanding its structure.  
- 📌 **Data Visualization:** Plotting sample hand landmarks.  
- 📌 **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing the data, handling missing values, and splitting into train/test sets.  
- 📌 **Model Training:** Implementing and comparing at least **three ML models** (e.g., **Random Forest, SVM**).  
- 📌 **Evaluation:** Reporting **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- 📌 **Conclusion:** Summarizing results and selecting the best model.  

### ✅ **2. Output Video**
🎥 A short video demonstrating the trained model in action:  
- **MediaPipe extracts hand landmarks** from each frame.  
- **Predictions are displayed** in real-time.  
- The video must be uploaded to **Google Drive** with a **public link**.
